# Advertisement Focus
Advertisements play a key role in the business process. This is the age of the internet, and advertisements are present everywhere, but most tend to be ignored and swept to the peripherals of the user’s minds, doomed to be reduced to little more than just background noise. So, what really engages a person when they’re watching something? What disengages them? Those are the questions we hope to answer by analysing user reactions to advertisements. Using facial recognition and sentiment analysis, we hope to discern what the reaction to the advertisements, or parts of the advertisements are so that we may figure out what strategies work when trying to hook a consumer, and what strategies fail.
